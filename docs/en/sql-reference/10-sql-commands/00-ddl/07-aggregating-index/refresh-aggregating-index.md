## Syntax

```sql
REFRESH AGGREGATING INDEX <index_name> [ LIMIT <limit> ]
```

The "LIMIT" parameter allows you to control the maximum number of blocks that can be updated with each refresh action. It is strongly recommended to use this parameter with a defined limit to optimize memory usage. Please also note that setting a limit may result in partial data updates. For example, if you have 100 blocks but set a limit of 10, a single refresh might not update the most recent data, potentially leaving some blocks unrefreshed. You may need to execute multiple refresh actions to ensure a complete update.

## When to Use REFRESH AGGREGATING INDEX

- **When Automatic Updates Fail:** In cases where the default automatic updates (`SYNC` mode) do not work properly, use `REFRESH AGGREGATING INDEX` to include any missed data in the index.
- **For ASYNC Indexes:** If aggregating index is created with the `ASYNC` option, it won't update automatically. You need to manually refresh it using `REFRESH AGGREGATING INDEX`.

## Examples

This example creates and refreshes an aggregating index named *my_agg_index*:

```sql
-- Prepare data
CREATE TABLE agg(a int, b int, c int);
INSERT INTO agg VALUES (1,1,4), (1,2,1), (1,2,4);

-- Create an aggregating index
CREATE AGGREGATING INDEX my_agg_index AS SELECT MIN(a), MAX(c) FROM agg;

-- Insert new data
INSERT INTO agg VALUES (2,2,5);

-- Refresh the aggregating index
REFRESH AGGREGATING INDEX my_agg_index;
```
